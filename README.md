# MiniPythonProjects
Collection of small coding projects/trinkets.

This README will host small descriptions of what the files below do, as well as differences in the runtimes of similar files.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

"fibonacci.py" and "recursiveFibonacci.py"
- The "fibonacci.py" file, through testing, was quicker than its recursive counterpart by ~0.004 seconds. (Not a large difference)

"monteCarloIntegration.py"
- Basic Monte Carlo Integration technique that uses a modified version of the formula for the average value of a 2-dimensional curve on interval [a,b], where f(a) and f(b) exist.
