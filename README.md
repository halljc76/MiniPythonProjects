# MiniPythonProjects
Collection of small coding projects/trinkets.

This README will host small descriptions of what the files below do, as well as differences in the runtimes of similar files.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

"FibonacciAlgos Folder"
- The "nonRecursionFibonacci.py" file, through testing, was quicker than its recursive counterpart by ~0.004 seconds. (Not a large difference)

"monteCarloIntegration.py"
- Basic Monte Carlo Integration technique that uses a modified version of the formula for the average value of a 2-dimensional curve on interval [a,b], where f(a) and f(b) exist. Supports a few elementary functions, with integer limits for sake of brevity (e.g., it would be rather pointless to find the integral from [99,100] of x^3).

"Timestamp Folder"
- Basic software applicable in, for example, YouTube-video making for denoting when edits are necessary.
